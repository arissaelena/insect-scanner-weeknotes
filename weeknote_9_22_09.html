        <h2>Laser cutting turntable plate</h2>
        <p>We decided on cutting a disc from clear plastic to use as our turntable plate, and then applying a matte white coating to it, as this was significantly cheaper. Tom, the department hardware specialist, was able to do the actual cutting for us.</p>
        <h2>LED setup</h2>
        <p>The nano tape has been delivered, so the USB wiring and LED strips can now be permanently fixed on the dome. Cable tape was used to wrap the black wires, and nano tape was used to hold both the cables and the LED strips in position.</p>
        <h2>Motor</h2>
        <p>Ari is configuring a stepper motor to be used with the DM556 microstep driver and a Raspberry Pi to control the rotation of the dome. She connected the components, and we had a power supply for the components delivered on Thursday. The gears connecting to the motor are printed and tested with this setup.</p>
        <h2>Printing</h2>
        <p>Anna has printed the smaller gears that form our turntable, and sheâ€™s been printing the remaining parts of our dome and turntable during the course of this week. There were some issues with the dome slices toppling over when nearing the end of a print, but she managed to fix the issue.</p>
        <h2>Insect corner</h2>
        <p>Insect fact of the week: (coming tomorrow).</p>
