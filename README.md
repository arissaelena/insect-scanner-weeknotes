Here you can view our weekly notes relating to our work on finding a reproducible low-cost and high-throughput alternative to the current technology used to scan specimens in the University of Cambridge Museum insect collection.
This project is being worked on by Arissa-Elena Rotunjanu, Beatrice Spence and Anna Yiu. This project is co-supervised by Tiffany Ki, Anil Madhavapeddy and Edgar Turner.
